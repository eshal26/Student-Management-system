#Student Management System
The provided code is a C++ program that manages student and faculty data in an educational institution. It includes classes and structures to represent students, faculties, courses, quizzes, assignments, projects, sessionals, and administrators.

The `person` struct represents basic personal information such as name, phone, address, and date of birth.
The `course` struct represents a course with properties like name, credit hours, faculty, fee, and ID.
The `quiz`, `assign`, `project`, and `sessional` structs represent different types of assessments with properties like name, marks, weightage, content, and ID.

The `student` class inherits from the `person` class and represents a student. It contains additional properties like enrolled courses, fees, hostel and transport information, and assessment marks. It also has functions for enrolling in courses, calculating fees, and displaying data.

The `faculty` class also inherits from the `person` class and represents a faculty member. It includes properties like designation and assessment-related functions to enter marks for quizzes, assignments, projects, and sessionals.

The `admin` class represents an administrator and has functions to add new faculties and students, as well as initialize the course and semester information.

Overall, this code provides a basic structure for managing student and faculty data and performing operations related to enrollment, assessment, and fee calculation. However, some parts of the code are incomplete or missing, and there may be logical or design issues that need to be addressed to make the program functional.# Student-Management-system
